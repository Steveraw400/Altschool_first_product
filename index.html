    <p>Hi my name is <b>Rawson osagie stephen</b></p>
    <p><b>Altschool ID:</b>ALT/SOE/025/1288</p>
    <h4>Biography</h4>
    <p>I am resident of Edo state in the Southern part of Nigeria where I grew up as a child that was always conscious about
        the environment around me, especially gadgets around the house such as TV's , Radios and mechanical toys that could
        talk or press a remote
        and it would start moving I always had a fascination about them and will always open them up eager to see what it
        was made of and couple them back up, as a child growing up I lost my father and my world came crashing down things
        became despairingly difficult, but in my heart I made a conscious decision that I would not give up on my
        education.My desire to become educated inspired me to gain admission into Nnamdi Azikiwe University Anambra state, I
        immediately started working as a bar tender in the popular club Gaga to cater for my bills while attending school at
        the same time and supporting my siblings as I was the first child of four siblings , My mum supported me with the
        little she can till I graduated as a science education student with a major in biology, I came back to Benin to
        support my mum getting a job in kitchen Master as a waiter serving food and drinks, itâ€™s a job where you get to meet
        various people, so on one faithful day on my way to the restaurant, my phone got stolen, I was deeply saddened by
        this,
        and cried so much about my contacts that I was to lose when a customer approached me and I explained my ordeal to
        him and he laughed, much to my amusement,that going forward when I get a new phone that I can save all my contacts
        to my email if I had one, and he promised to get a phone for me and set up an email for me.
        I was intrigued and asked him what he did for work, and he replied "I am a cloud engineer" and I got so interested
        and started going to cafe to research what it was all about and I discovered that cloud engineering was a kind of
        technology that seeks to aid companies, businesses, users secure their data and information, meaning cloud engineers
        were like the super heroes I watched as a child coming to the rescue to save the day. This experience reignited my
        passion for technology, when the use of Point of sale terminal popularly called Pos and bar-code was introduce to
        the eatery I was one of the first staff to get myself acquainted with the device and the use of bar-codes to make
        orders for drinks and food. The restaurant made more profit that it ever made when Pos was introduced and we were
        glad for it, I had to save most of my salary and tips to get a fairly used laptop so that I can stop going to the
        cafe and be at the comfort of my home and do all my research, this is a sheer testimony of diligence and
        perseverance.
        You may ask why cloud engineering, I am very interested to know how companies and businesses safeguard data and
        ensure that their business are up and running round the clock, bill gates who is my favorite mentor once said any
        business in the 21st century ought to have functional a website for global reach, I realized that a cloud engineer
        is also necessary to ensure businesses and companies function optimally, this discovery sparked my desire to become
        a cloud engineer and provide top notch services to customers and businesses.
        During my research I discovered a learning platform called Udemy and saved up money and had certification of
        completion in Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (Az900) and Microsoft Azure Administrator (Az104), so that I can be in
        the best position for opportunities like this as I delved deeper I discovered that there are three major cloud
        services,
        each offering a vast array of services this overwhelmed me, and I was unsure about how to proceed, so I reached out
        to my customer turned friend and he suggested I checked out a learning platform called AltSchool Africa similar to
        Udemy but with a clear pathway , where I could get a more structured pathway to get the necessary skills to
        achieve my dreams of becoming a cloud engineer.My story serves as a testament to the power of perseverance and
        vision.
        It shows that no matter how difficult the journey may seem, success is achievable with dedication and a clear sense
        of purpose.
        Through my passion for technology, my commitment to self-improvement, and my desire to uplift others, I represent
        the values that the Ayoba developer scholarship stands for.
        I am not just looking for an education; I am striving to build a better future for myself, family and my community.
